    <h1>Recipes for every foodie</h1>
    
    <p>My Indian tastebuds were tingling for some home cooking, so while rummaging through my cupboards I came across a packet of Chicken Tikka Masala my mom bought me when she last visited and then I was craving it.  It’s Indian comfort food at it’s best.</p>

    <p>For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indian cuisine, Chicken Tikka masala is chunks of spicy marinated chicken pieces grilled and simmered in a creamy tomato sauce. It’s a staple on any Indian restaurant menu.</p>
